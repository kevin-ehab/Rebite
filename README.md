# 🥗 ReBite – Community Food Waste Sharing Platform

**ReBite** is a Flask-based web application that helps reduce food waste by allowing community members to log and share excess food. Users can offer leftover or untouched food to others in their area, categorized as:

- 🐾 **For Pets** – suitable for animal consumption  
- 🍽️ **Untouched** – fresh and edible food for people
